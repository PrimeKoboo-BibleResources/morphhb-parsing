ParsingApp contains the local PHP application for parsing the OSHB.

You can prepare the application for running by opening up
DataPass.php, and changing 'username' and 'password' to
contain the actual username and password for the database connection.

The application can be installed on a local server, maintaining the
internal directory structure.

Running the application should present you with the startup screen.
Changing the chapter number will load the selected book and chapter,
or you can use the Select button to get the current selection.

Once a chapter is loaded, the parsing interface will appear, and you
can start parsing.  When you apply a parsing, it will be added to the
title of the given word, so it can be viewed by hovering on the word.

This is still a preliminary form of the application, for testing
purposes.  The online version is approaching the point where we can
start actual parsing.
